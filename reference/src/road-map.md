# Roadmap

This document is a living road map of the Adama Platform. As such, it contains the investment details for the entire vision and future products.

## Developer relations &amp; adoption
The current story for developers is "meh", so these items help improve and modernize the developer experience.

## Web management
The [online web portal](https://ide.adama-platform.com) needs a lot of work to be useful.
NOTE: It may make more sense to fully deprecate the IDE as it takes time and isn't that useful.

## Infrastructure - Protocols
For integration across different ecosystems, there are more protocols to bridge gaps.

## Infrastructure - Core Service
Adama is a service.

The vision is for a runtime just for games. [See this post for more information](https://www.adama-platform.com/2022/12/02/case-new-game-engine.html)
